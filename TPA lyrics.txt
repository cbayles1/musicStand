(intro, starts with A and morphs into B)

Of all the lovers that you tried
Did any of them satisfy?
Did any of them fill the void in your heart?

And of all the whoopie that you made
It was great sure, but you still had to pay.
Did you think you'd find Prince Charming in a whorehouse?

Could there be an answer?
Where could a true love be?
Well what if I told you
That the one who's loved you from the start
He's been right there all along.

(instrumental verse)

Oh all those riches you aquired
Fell right through your pocket when you got fired
Was a fortune ever really gonna change your life?

And all the times you sat around
Writing songs you knew wouldn't sell
Did you ever think the heaven you sung of could be real?

Could there be an answer?
Where could true wealth lie?
Well what if I told you
That the one who wants to give you the world
He's been right there all along.
